        <h1>My First Calculator</h1>
        <p>Hey I'm John Doe. I'm the biggest calculator nerd ever. I want to make the best calculator apps.</p>
        <p>This is the first time I use this web stuff. Watched some tutorials about security? Who cares right?</p>
        <p>I'm trying to learn all programming languages by making calculators. Herd all of them were extra safe.</p>
        <h3>Links to my calculators</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/sql">SQL Calculator</a></li>
            <li><a href="/php">PHP Calculator</a></li>
        </ul>
